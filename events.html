        <div class="bread">
          <div class="textblock">True to tradition we will once again offer a free city walk to those arriving
            early, or who just happen to live nearby.</div>
          <div class="textblock">On Thursday April 17th we invite you to join us for a walk from Majorstua to
            Aker Brygge. The meetup point will be at Vinkelplassen at Majorstua by 11:00. We will depart
            shortly thereafter.
          </div>
          <div class="textblock">The first stop will be the world famous Frognerparken, with its sculpture
            park by Gustav Vigeland. We will spend a bit of time here taking a good look at the main part of
            the park.</div>
          <div class="textblock">From the park we will follow a little river down to Sk√∏yen, a former
            industrial area turned into fancy office space. From there we will cross the highway and follow
            the waterfront past the Color Line cruise terminal to Aker Brygge, known for its architecture
            and expensive apartments.</div>
          <div class="textblock">
            This will lead us to our final stop, Via Village, where we will have lunch. The estimated time
            of arrival here is around 14:00.

            Fursuits are welcome, but no fursuit support is provided. <br>

            Using a wheelchair? Most of the trip is on paved roads, but the section from the park to Sk√∏yen
            is on a dirt road with a couple steep moments. <br>

          <div class="textblock">Just like the last two years we‚Äôre once again looking forward to a pre-party bowling
            event, which takes place the evening before the party at Lucky Bowl Veitvet
            <a href="https://luckybowl.no/oslo/">(webite)</a>. A fun night of strikes and
            gutters,
            perfect for getting to know new people before the big party.
          </div>
          <div class="textblock">Tickets for the bowling are purchased together with the party ticket and
            includes two rounds of
            bowling. Further rounds can be bought on site directly from the venue.</div>
          <div class="textblock">A simple changing room will be provided. Here you can put on your suit,
            store
            your luggage, and
            get some water. Note that the room does have small windows towards the lobby and hallway
            inside,
            so we can not offer complete privacy.</div>
          <div class="textblock">Food and drinks can be bought onsite, you are not allowed to bring your
            own.

        <div class="bread">
          <div class="textblock">After a long night of dancing and partying, it‚Äôs nice to relax and recuperate. At The Well warm pools, jacuzzis, steam bath and other wellness attractions awaits your sore muscles and aching heads.</a>
          <div class="textblock">This is not an 'official' event, and tickets cannot be bought through Pawske Party. We're happy to coordinate a group of those who want to go to the well together and enjoy a Spa day there. Please be aware that you have to buy your ticket for The Well separately.</a>
          <div class="textblock">The Well is the biggest spa center in the Nordic region and offers a wide array of things to do, including various wellness rituals that are included in the ticket. On their website you can also add up-charges like a massage or various skin treatments. We recommend you check out their <a href="https://thewell.no/en/">website</a> for all they have to offer.</a>
          <div class="textblock">At The Well you are free to choose between being naked and wearing swimming clothes. Saunas can only be used naked. You are only allowed to wear The Well‚Äôs own brand that can be bought in the reception upon arrival.</a>
          <div class="textblock">The Well is located a bit outside of Oslo and is accessed by car or bus. There will not be an organized travel out to the center, but it is easy to find. The Well is located at Kongeveien 65, 1412 Sofiemyr and has its own parking lot. From Jernbanetorget in Oslo you can take bus 81 towards Myrvoll Stasjon to Granholtet. Find your best route on <a href="https://entur.no/">EnTur</a> or through Google.</a>
          <div class="textblock">We‚Äôll gather by the front entrance sunday 20.4. at 12:00. Keep in mind that you can essentially come and go as you please, as this is just a group coordination offer.</a>
