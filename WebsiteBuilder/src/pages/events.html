					<div class="textblock">True to tradition we will once again offer a free city walk to those arriving
						early, or who just happen to live nearby.</div>
					<div class="textblock">On Thursday April 17th we invite you to join us for a walk from Majorstua to
						Aker Brygge. The meetup point will be at Vinkelplassen at Majorstua by 11:00. We will depart
						shortly thereafter.
					</div>
					<div class="textblock">The first stop will be the world famous Frognerparken, with its sculpture
						park by Gustav Vigeland. We will spend a bit of time here taking a good look at the main part of
						the park.</div>
					<div class="textblock">From the park we will follow a little river down to Skøyen, a former
						industrial area turned into fancy office space. From there we will cross the highway and follow
						the waterfront past the Color Line cruise terminal to Aker Brygge, known for its architecture
						and expensive apartments.</div>
					<div class="textblock">
						This will lead us to our final stop, Via Village, where we will have lunch. The estimated time
						of arrival here is around 14:00.
					</div>

					<div class="textblock">
						Bring shoes you can walk in, water, and maybe a snack. <br>

						Fursuits are welcome, but no fursuit support is provided. <br>

						Using a wheelchair? Most of the trip is on paved roads, but the section from the park to Skøyen
						is on a dirt road with a couple steep moments. <br>
