				<div class="bread">
					<div class="textblock">Last year we explored downtown Oslo. This year, we explore the old
						industrial
						side of Oslo with a
						walk down Akerselva, from Nydalen. The meet-up point is by Torgbygget Brua <a
							href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/wm4baooxDzo2AZsq7">(link on google maps)</a> , right
						outside the metro station at 12:00.</div>
					<div class="textblock">From there we walk down along the scenic walkway by the river, stopping
						to
						look at the historical
						buildings along the way. At around 13:15 we will reach Mathallen <a
							href="https://mathallenoslo.no/en/">(website)</a> where we will stop for lunch.</div>
					<div class="textblock">The walk ends at Outland <a href="https://www.outland.no">(website)</a>

					<div class="textblock">Tickets for the bowling are purchased together with the party ticket and
						includes two rounds of
						bowling. Further rounds can be bought on site directly from the venue.</div>
					<div class="textblock">A simple changing room will be provided. Here you can put on your suit,

						inside,
