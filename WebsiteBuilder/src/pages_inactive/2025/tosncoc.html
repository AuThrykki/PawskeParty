							Clothing and Decency
						</div>
						Pawske Party wants to be as tolerant and welcoming as possible towards all attendees. This means

						flyers,

						part
						of a costume. This can include, for example, bondage gear, harnesses, or muzzles; or materials

						Non-sexual accessories, for example dog harnesses on fursuits, pup hoods, pet suits and similar

						about
						doing something in public, don’t do it.
